PCA is not a generative algorithm. It is used for data compression. In image processing too, it has an interesting application where all images of a
particular class can be reprsented in a low dimensional format. This approach is more commonly known as eigenfaces. Here's a [link][https://www.face-rec.org/interesting-papers/General/ld.pdf] 
to it's original paper. In the notebook, I've implemented the eigenface procedure and have also tried image generation using it. The data used can be
